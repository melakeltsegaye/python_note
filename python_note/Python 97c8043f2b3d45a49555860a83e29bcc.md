# Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

A tuple in Python is a collection of ordered and immutable elements. Tuples are written with round brackets. For example, `my_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")`. Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are often used for data that should not be changed, such as days of the week or dates on a calendar.

```jsx
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

```

Tuples in Python are extremely versatile. While they are often used for data that should not be changed, they can be used in a variety of other ways as well. For example, tuples can be used to store multiple values in a single variable. This is particularly useful when you want to return more than one value from a function.

Here's an example:

```jsx
def get_info():
  return ("John", "Doe", 25)

name, surname, age = get_info()

```

In this example, the function `get_info()` returns a tuple, which is then unpacked into the variables `name`, `surname`, and `age`.

Tuples also support various built-in functions like `count()` and `index()`. `count()` returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple and `index()` searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found.

```jsx
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple")
print(mytuple.count("apple"))  # Output: 2
print(mytuple.index("banana"))  # Output: 1

```

Tuples can also be used for sequence unpacking. Python assigns the corresponding value from the tuple to each variable:

```jsx
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
(a, b, c) = fruits
print(a)  # Output: apple

```

In this example, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of the tuple `fruits` respectively.

A list in Python is a collection of ordered and mutable elements. Lists are written with square brackets. For example, `my_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`. Unlike tuples, lists can be changed after they are created. You can add, remove, and modify elements in a list. Here's an example:

```jsx
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist[1] = "blackcurrant"  # This changes the second item

```

Furthermore, Python provides several built-in functions and methods to work with lists.

One such function is `append()`, which allows you to add an item to the end of a list:

```jsx
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist.append("dragonfruit")  # This adds 'dragonfruit' to the end of the list

```

The `remove()` method removes the first occurrence of an element:

```jsx
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist.remove("banana")  # This removes 'banana' from the list

```

Python also supports list comprehension, which is a compact way of creating lists based on existing lists. Here's an example:

```jsx
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]

```

In the above example, `newlist` will be a new list containing only the fruits with the letter "a".

A set in Python is a collection of unique and unordered elements. Sets are written with curly brackets. For example, `my_set = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}`. Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.

To add one item to a set, you can use the `add()` method:

```jsx
myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
myset.add("orange")  # This adds 'orange' to the set

```

To add more than one item to a set, you can use the `update()` method:

```jsx
myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
myset.update(["orange", "mango", "grapes"])  # This adds 'orange', 'mango' and 'grapes' to the set

```

To remove an item from a set, you can use the `remove()` or `discard()` method:

```jsx
myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
myset.remove("banana")  # This removes 'banana' from the set

```

However, if the item to remove does not exist, `remove()` will raise an error, whereas `discard()` will not.

Python also provides set operations like union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference. Here's an example:

```jsx
set1 = {"a", "b" , "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}

set3 = set1.union(set2)
print(set3)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c'}

```

In this example, `union()` method returns a set that contains all items from both sets, without any duplicates.

A dictionary in Python is a collection of unordered, changeable, and indexed elements. Each element in a dictionary is a key-value pair. Dictionaries are written with curly brackets. For example, `my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30}`.

Dictionaries are often used when you want to store information that can be looked up by a unique key. Here's an example:

```jsx
mydict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(mydict["model"])  # Output: Mustang

```

In this example, `"brand"`, `"model"`, and `"year"` are keys, and `"Ford"`, `"Mustang"`, and `1964` are their respective values.

You can modify the values in a dictionary:

```jsx
mydict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict["year"] = 2020

```

In this example, the value of the `"year"` key is changed to `2020`.

You can also add new key-value pairs to a dictionary:

```jsx
mydict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict["color"] = "red"

```

In this example, a new key-value pair `"color": "red"` is added to the `mydict` dictionary.

To remove a key-value pair from a dictionary, you can use the `pop()` method:

```jsx
mydict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict.pop("model")

```

In this example, the `"model"` key-value pair is removed from the `mydict` dictionary.

python for loop

```jsx
for i in range(0, 12):
 print(i)
#1-11
```

The enumerate object yields pairs containing a count (from start, which defaults to zero) and a value yielded by the iterable argument.

enumerate is useful for obtaining an indexed list:
(0, seq[0]), (1, seq[1]), (2, seq[2]), ...

```jsx

stud = ["tony", "melakel"]

for i, v in enumerate(stud):
 print(v)

for v in enumerate(stud):
 print(v)
```

if else in python

```jsx
x = 5
y = 3

if x > y:
 print(x)
elif x==y:
 print("equal")
else: 
 print(y)
```

function in python

```jsx
def h():
  print("hi")

h()

#hi

def greet(name):
 print(f'hellow {name}')

greet('melakel')

#hellow melakel
```

default argument in function in the code bellow the default argument is id = 1 it is useful in case it is not passed in the function call

```jsx
def greet(name, age, id = '1'):
 print(f'hellow {name} age: {age} id: {id}')

greet('melakel', age = 21)
```

In Python, arguments can be passed to a function in two ways - positional arguments and keyword arguments. Positional arguments are arguments that need to be passed in the same order as defined in the function declaration.

Here's an example:

```jsx
def greet(name, age):
 print(f'Hello {name}, you are {age} years old')

greet('John', 21)

```

In this example, 'John' is a positional argument that gets assigned to the parameter `name`, and `21` is a positional argument for `age`. It's important to note that the order of arguments matters. If you were to call `greet(21, 'John')`, it would result in an incorrect output - 'Hello 21, you are John years old'.

Keyword arguments are arguments that are passed to a function with a keyword and equals sign. This means you do not have to worry about argument order.

Here's an example:

```jsx
def greet(name, age):
 print(f'Hello {name}, you are {age} years old')

greet(age=21, name='John')

```

In this example, `age=21` and `name='John'` are keyword arguments. Even though `age` is passed before `name`, Python knows to assign `21` to `age` and `'John'` to `name` because of the keywords. This would output 'Hello John, you are 21 years old'.

In Python, formatted string literals, or f-strings, are a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`. The expressions will be replaced with their values when the string is created. This makes it easy to create strings that include variable values or computed expressions. Here's an example:

```jsx
name = "John"
age = 30
print(f"Hello, {name}. You are {age} years old.")

```

In this example, `name` and `age` are variables that are replaced by their values in the f-string. The output will be: 'Hello, John. You are 30 years old.'

You can include any expression that can be evaluated by Python inside the curly braces of an f-string. This includes arithmetic expressions, function calls, and more. Here's an example:

```jsx
x = 10
y = 20
print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} is {x + y}.")

```

In this example, the arithmetic expression `x + y` is included inside the curly braces. The output will be: 'The sum of 10 and 20 is 30.'

F-strings are a powerful tool in Python for creating formatted strings. They are easy to use, readable, and efficient.
